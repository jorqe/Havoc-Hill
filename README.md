The project that our group would like to do for our Sr. capstone is a VR (Virtual Reality)
game. To develop this game, we plan on using C# and Unity game engine. The main theme
of the game is a first-person shooter that is a king-of-the-hill styled game. We would also like
to add a form of educational content to this game. We plan on doing a second language other
than English, we will most likely implement Spanish into the game.
For the first semester we plan on working on the core game-play mechanics. This includes but is
not limited to implementing a player object, weapons, enemies and a scoring system. We would
also like to implement a main menu so that the player could enter and leave the game. The core
game-play we would have to focus on this semester would be how the enemies damage/affect
the player. The other big feature we would have to focus on would be how weapons/bullets
interact with the player, the world and the enemies. We will also plan on creating a database
of the trivia we want to implement in the future for this project.
For the second semester we plan on fleshing out the game. To do this we would add the quiz
aspect of the game, individual rounds divided by a quiz/upgrade system, a saving mechanic, so
the player doesnâ€™t have to restart a run/game every time they play. Then, if we have enough
time we would like to add difficulties/game modifiers. These could affect game difficulty and
trivia difficulty. Then, if the game is running smoothly towards the end of the semester, we
plan on adding different maps that could be chosen from the main menu. The trivia system
will be implemented into the game-play, then the quiz will be in between rounds.
